# Currency APP
Currency APP is an app developed to show some of my skills applied in consuming a countries currency list from API. When you click in a currency it brings the item to the top and it becomes the reference for the bellow items. When you change the value for the reference it will show the representative value on other countries' currency. The list updates every 1 second for a specific requirement.
